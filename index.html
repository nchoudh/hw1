                <h3>Medicine</h3>
                <p>
                  Nadim's exposure to medicine began at an early age as his father and mother had both been trained as physicians in Bangladesh.
                  His family migrated to the U.S. in the mid-80's and his father became licensed and trained as a pulmonologist and critical care specialist while his mother ran the private practice.
                  Nadim grew up around hospitals and clinics and saw how integral quality medicine was to a small community.
                  After majoring in neurobiology and minoring in education at the University of Florida, he was admitted to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was at Mount Sinai where he was able to learn both the science and the art of how medicine is practiced.
                  He was drawn to work outside of the classroom with underserved communities through health and education initiatives.
                  It was through this opportunities that he would learn how much he enjoyed organizing and leading teams in healthcare to make a broader impact.

                <h3>Business</h3>
                <p>
                  After his third year of medical school, Nadim pursued a research year in ophthalmology to confirm whether this specialty was the right fit for him.
                  While he did not enjoy the clinical research side of medicine, he began devoting his time to coordinating a international surgical mission trip to Mongolia with Virtue Foundation.
                  His experience leading a team there to provide over 280 surgeries in two weeks would confirm his desire to practice medicine with the ultimate goal of being involved in hospital management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During his fourth year of medical school, he decided to apply to business school to obtain his MBA before beginning his residency training.
                  He decided to attend the Kellogg School of Management in Evanston, IL based on its overall strengths as well as a strong industry focus on healthcare management.

                <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                <p> Nadim decided on anesthesiology as his future specialty because of the experiences he had during his fourth year rotations.
                  As he finishes his final year at Kellogg, he is applying to the residency matching process. This site will update as he embarks upon this process.
                </p>
                <p> His goal will be to find a program that has strong didactics, residency culture and opportunities to be exposed to hospital leadership and be engaged in quality improvement initiatives.
